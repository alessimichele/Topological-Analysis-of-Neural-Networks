# Topological-Analysis-of-Neural-Networks
Final project for Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course.

The project's objective is to investigate topological properties, and potentially, topological invariants, related to both the weights and activations within a neural network.

This is achieved through a two-step process: first, clustering the final network activations and then examining the neurons that exhibit the highest activation within each cluster.

Subsequently, after identifying these "most significant neurons" in the network, a detailed analysis is conducted, focusing on their respective weights.
